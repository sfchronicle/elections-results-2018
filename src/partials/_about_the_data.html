<div class="hed">About the data</div>
<div class="chatter">
  <p>National and state election results are published from data provided by the Associated Press.  Thousands of correspondents periodically report the results from local election centers across the country, and the resulting tabulated data are disseminated to member organizations.</p>

  <p>Local results are updated from data posted by the Department of Elections or Office of the Registrar of Voters in each of the nine Bay Area counties.</p>

  <p>Except for certain state and local races, which are called by a San Francisco Chronicle senior editor, race winners and electoral votes are called by AP state and Washington bureaus.</p>
